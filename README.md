Our team has selected the theme for sustaining our planet for future generations.

Introduction - There is a concern worldwide that environmental issues we face today will have an impact on future generations. Our challenge is to create a way to communicate the importance of environmental responsibility to people of all generations.

Based on the NASA dataset that we analysed, the rate of carbon dioxide, the global temperature and sea level are all increasing over the years. One of the main contributors to the climate change problem is air pollution. As the number of car productions is increasing as well, indirectly, the amount of harmful gases that limited form car's exhaust are increasing too.

Our team has a took into a consideration to overcome this problem that has grown with alarming rates. We have a proposal idea that yet might be possible for future invention, that is "Nuclear Powered Car".

It does not exist yet, but it is theoretically possible. If a mini nuclear reactor can fit into a small size submarine, why don't we implement this innovation into a car? Further explanation is explained throughout the 3 minutes pitching videos.
