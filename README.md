Our team selected theme for susatain our planet for future generations

Introduction - There is concern worldwide that enviromental issues we face today will have an impact on future generations. Our challenge is to create a way to communicate the inmportance of environmental responsibility to people of all generation.

Based on the NASA dataset that we analaysed, the rate emiting of carbon dioxide, the global temperature and sea level are all increasing over the years. One of the main contributor for climate change problem is air pollution. As the number of car productions are increasing as well, indirectly, the number of harmful gas that emmited form car's exhaust are increasing too.

Our team has a took in a consideration to overcome this problem that grown with alarming rates. We have a proposal idea that yet might be possible for future invention, that is "Nuclear Powered Car"
